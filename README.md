1 Billion Row Challenge 
============== 

# Source
- Article
This code is to test and practice Python examples found at [1BRC](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-one-billion-row-challenge-from-10-minutes-to-4-seconds-0718662b303e)

# Background
- Current Top performing implementation is JAVA @ 1.535 seconds
- Author has run the code 5 times each and averaged results
- Author using 16" M3 Pro Macbook Pro w/12CPU cores and 36GB of RAM

# CodersCookbook
- Using 16" M1 Macbook Pro

# The Challenge
"The idea behind the 1 Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is simple — go through a .txt file that contains arbitrary temperature measurements and calculate summary statistics for each station (min, mean, and max). The only issues are that you’re working with 1 billion rows and that the data is stored in an uncompressed .txt format."

Dataset is generated by the `data/createMeasurements.py` script -- copied from [source](https://github.com/ifnesi/1brc#submitting)

# Running the Code

1. Create a new dataset locally by running `data/createMeasurements.py`. Final Dataset will be around 13.8GB
2. Set paths to new local dataset in each 
3. Run scripts individually or all at once with `1brc_all.py`

# Results
TBD as of 2024/05/09
